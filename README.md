## Stuffr

Stuffr is a web-based appplication to manage your *things*. It makes it easy to manage a database of items and all their related data - keep track of receipts, photos, purchase dates, serial numbers, any sort of information you might need.

### Browser frontend

This repository contains the user interface code for Stuffr. It presents a browser-based interface to the backend server. While it is the "main" frontend, more are planned in the future (e.g. native phone apps).
